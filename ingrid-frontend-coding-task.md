# Ingrid Front-end Coding Assignment

This is a small coding assignment to assess a candidate's skill regarding front-end development.

## Description

We need to build a small web based currency converter that can answer the questions:
What is 200 SEK converted into multiple other currencies like USD, GBP and SGD?
How much has currency changed in valuation between March 26th, 2015 and June 13th, 2017?
To answer this questions you can use fixer.io to get your currencies data. We would also like to see the web app persist state on page reload.

## Technology stack

- React
- Any third party packages of frameworks you want to use.

## Requirements

We should be able to run the code on our computer. Hint: A good README.txt goes a long way.
         
## What we are looking at

Here is a list of what we are looking at when judging your work:

- Your ability to learn new technologies
- Your ability to translate requirements into working implementation
- Your ability to write code that is easy to follow and understand
- Your ability to document and explain non-coding requirements if there are any
